            <div className="verify-card">
              <h3>Low-KYC Platforms</h3>
              <p>These let you play anonymously until hitting specific withdrawal thresholds (usually 0.5-2 BTC). Then verification kicks in. They're "no-KYC" until you win big‚Äîthen suddenly they need documents.</p>
